# Stanza Python SDK

Stanza is a developer-first tool for increasing reliability based on prioritized traffic management, quota allocation, and rate-limiting. On the back-end, it helps prevent downtime related to overload and excessive use of third-party APIs. On the front-end, it helps segment and weight your traffic, react automatically to overload or other conditions, and inspect the state of your critical user journeys.

"Stanza Python SDK" provides higher-order functions (["decorators"](https://docs.dev.getstanza.dev/glossary#decorator)) for adding this fault tolerance to your Python 3 application.
